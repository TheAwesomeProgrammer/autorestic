# Migration from `1.7` to `1.8`

## Config files

- The config version have been changed
- You can now configure restore hooks

See detailed instructions below.

## Config Version

The version field of the config file has been changed from `2` to `3`.

## Hooks

Since `1.8` both backup and restore hooks are possible.
For this reason, backup hooks have been moved one layer deeper, you have to move them in a `backup` object.

Before:

```yaml
locations:
  l1:
    # ...
    from: /foo/bar
    hooks:
      before:
        - pwd
```

After:

```yaml
locations:
  l1:
    # ...
    from: /foo/bar
    hooks:
      backup:
        before:
          - pwd
      restore:
        after:
          - echo "My super restore hook"
```
